         <p class="start">  With more than 30,000 years of history, India is the birthplace of numerous cultures and religions 
                making it one of the most important tourist destinations in the world. Being ruled over various dynasties 
                and kingdoms before being established as a republic in the 20th century, India has more than thousand tourist 
                attractions and several World Heritage Sites. Listed below are some of the most extravagant places you can visit in India.
                Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. 
                Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, 
                second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of 
                the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.
                By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest. 
                Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda 
                records the dawning of Hinduism in India.The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.
                By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, 
                proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires 
                based in the Ganges Basin.Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,but also marked by the declining 
                status of women,and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.In South India, the Middle 
                kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.</p>

        <p>The name<small>Taj Mahal</small>,translates to the<small>‘Crown Palace’</small>and is one of the most famous and marvelous buildings in India.
             Located in the<small>city of Agra</small>,Taj Mahal is actually a mausoleum built to house the remains of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of
             <small>Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.</small>The building is known for its extensive use of white marble and was completed in the mid-17th
             century.The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. 
             It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan<small>(r. 1628–1658)</small>to house the tomb of his favourite wife, 
             Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a<small>17-hectare (42-acre)</small>complex, 
             which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
             Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for 
             another 10 years. 
             <br>
             <br>
             The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in<small>1653</small>at a cost estimated at 
             the time to be around<small>₹32 million</small>,which in<small>2020</small>would be approximately<small>₹70 billion (about US $1 billion).</small>The construction 
             project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor’s 
             court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.

        <p> The<small>Ladakh</small>is a region administered by India as a union territory and constitutes an eastern portion of <small>the larger Kashmir region</small>
            that has been the subject of<small>a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947 and India and China since 1959.</small>Ladakh is 
            bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south, both<small>the Indian-administered 
            union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west</small>,and the southwest corner of Xinjiang 
            across the Karakoram Pass in the far north. It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great 
            Himalayas to the south.The eastern end, consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian Government 
            as part of Ladakh, and has been under Chinese control since 1962.
            In the past, Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes,but as Chinese 
            authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled.
            <br>
            <br>
            The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.The Leh district contains 
            the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the Suru, Dras and Zanskar river valleys. The main 
            populated regions are the river valleys, but the mountain slopes also support pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious 
            groups in the region are Muslims<small>(mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan Buddhists) (40%), and Hindus (12%)</small>with the 
            remaining 2% made of other religions. Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions in India. Its culture and 
            history are closely related to those of Tibet.

            <small>Goa is the smallest state in India that lies between the Sahyadri range of the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea on 
            the west coast of India.</small>The capital of Goa is Panaji and its official language is Konkani. Also known as the fun capital, 
            <small>Goa is a tourist Destination in India that boasts perky beaches, swanky nightlife, the old city charm of churches and 
            cathedrals, lush green palm trees, cashew plantations, vibrant carnivals, flea markets, scrumptious cuisines,</small>and an array 
            of recreational activities. A party state, Goa throbs with the beats of music as every day is a carnival here. Famous for
            the cheerful nightlife, Goa is all about fun and merry-making.
            <br>
            The smallest state on the western coast of India, Goa has always attracted the powerful dynasties, traders, merchants, 
            seafarers, monks, and missionaries. Enclosed with the tales of various settlements, wars, and defeats, the history of Goa 
            is replete with events that follow one after the other. Once the major trading centers in India, Saraswat Brahmins are known 
            to be the first inhabitants of the state. In the 3rd Century BC, Mauryans invaded Goa and made it a part of their empire. 
            In the 11th century, Goa was dominated by the Hindu dynasties - Satavahanas of Kolhapur, the Chalukyas of Badami, Silharas, 
            and Kadambas. The first phase of Goa’s Golden Age was marked by the arrival of the Kadamba dynasty.
            In the 15th Century, Goa became a part of the Muslim Bahmani Kingdom of the Deccan. In 1498,<small>Vasco da Gama</small>
            helped the Portuguese to take control over the spice route from the East that was passing through the state and they 
            carried out the control for more than 4 centuries until they were defeated by the Marathas by the end of 18th century.

            <p> <small>Ooty is a scenic hill town in southern India.</small>It is surrounded by<small>the Nilgiri Hills</small>and is popularly known as the Queen 
                of Hills. But when is the best time to visit Ooty? Climate (if any) is the only serious deterrent which might spoil your 
                travel plans to Ooty. But regarding climate too, Ooty has something different to offer all throughout the year. 
                The summer is perhaps the best time to visit the place, if you are planning to visit all the tourist spots, including 
                some adventurous treks and hand gliding.
            </p>
            <h3>Ooty in Summer (March – June) </h3>
            <p>The summer season is perhaps the best time to visit Ooty hill station. With<small>the average temperature ranging around 25°C,</small>
                days can be a little hot though, especially during the afternoon. But at other times, the heat is bearable. The occasional 
                rains also sweep away some heat to keep Ooty enjoyable. And it even gets cold enough at night for you to put on some warm 
                clothes. With only the occasional warmth of the sun there to remind you that it is actually summer, you can comfortably 
                visit any place you have in mind in and around Ooty, without having to fear the dreaded heat.
            </p>
            <h3>Ooty in Monsoon (July – October)  </h3>
            <p>
                If you plan to visit as many tourist spots as possible, monsoon season isn’t the best time to visit Ooty with family. 
                The monsoons can be a real party crasher, if you are planning on covering maximum tourist spots in Ooty during your visit.
                 But if you are at Ooty just as a nature enthusiast, then monsoon is the best time. The mountains are filled with a new life,
                with,<small>once dry waterfalls flowing wild and mountain rivers running fearlessly.</small>A whole new range of flora reveals itself in 
                the Nilgiris encouraged by the monsoons and you are surely in for a treat.
            </p>

            <h3>Ooty in Winter (November – February)  </h3>
            <p> Winter is a totally different ball game in Ooty. Though the treks and adventure sports have a high probability of being 
                closed due to visibility and safety issues, you can visit all other popular tourist places. With<small>the temperatures in between 
                5°C and 17°C and low visibility</small>,adventure in Ooty isn’t a viable option in the winter season. The misty mountains and the 
                chilling cold will definitely bring out the lover in you if you are travelling to Ooty for your honeymoon or if you are with 
                your special person. There will not be anyone who would not wish a morning walk through the misty winter roads of Ooty with 
                the one you<small>love.</small>

                <p> Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. 
                    Mark Twain, the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote : 
                </p>    
                    <h5>“Benaras is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together”.</h5>
                <p> <small>The land of Varanasi (Kashi)</small>has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages. Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the

                    yoga and Hindi language</small>and honored authors such as the ever-famous<small>novelist Prem Chand and Tulsi Das</small>,the famous saint-poet who wrote

            <p> At<small>the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate</small>,an <small>“Arc-de-Triomphe”</small>like archway in the middle of a crossroad. 
                Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates<small>the 70,000 Indian soldiers</small>who lost their lives fighting for the 
                British Army during the World War I. The memorial bears the names of more than 13,516 British and Indian soldiers killed in 
                the Northwestern Frontier in<small>the Afghan war of 1919.</small>
                The foundation stone of India Gate was laid by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Connaught in 1921 and it was designed by Edwin 
                Lutyens. The monument was dedicated to the nation 10 years later by the then Viceroy, Lord Irwin. Another memorial, Amar Jawan 
                Jyoti was added much later, after India got its independence. The eternal flame burns day and night under the arch to remind the 
                nation of soldiers who laid down their lives in the Indo-Pakistan War of December 1971.
                <br>
                <br>
                The entire arch stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a huge moulding. The cornice is 
                inscribed with the Imperial suns while both sides of the arch have INDIA, flanked by the dates<small>MCMXIV (1914 left) and 
                MCMXIX (1919 right).</small>The shallow domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries but 
                this is rarely done.During nightfall, India Gate is dramatically floodlit while the fountains nearby make a lovely display with

            <p> Charminar was built by<small>Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591.</small>It is said that this square shaped structure with<small>four pillars</small>and intricate 
                carvings was built in honour of his wife,<small>Bhagmati.</small>However, the actual reason behind building Charminar is still not clear.
                As per a popular belief, Charminar was built to acknowledge the elimination of the plague which had affected the entire city immensely during 
                that era. It is believed that the Sultan had prayed for the end of this plague with which his people were suffering. Hence, as the plague ended, he built the
                charminar as a tribute to Allah. The four pillars are also said to be dedicated to the first four<small>caliphs of Islam.</small>
                It is also said that it was built in the memory of Prophet Muhammed’s son in law who lost his life at the battle of Karbala as its design is in the 
                shape of Shiya Tazias. Some also believe that the location of Charminar is the place where Sultan had seen his then future wife Bahgmati for the first time.
                As per a French traveller, Jean de Thévenot who travelled in the 17th century, the reason for its construction is entirely different.
                <br>
                <br> 
                According to his narration which 
                is in sync with the Persian texts as well, Charminar was built to commemorate the start of the second Islamic millennium.
                The inscription on the foundation stone is translated as ‘Fill this my city with people as, Thou hast filled the river with fishes, O Lord.’ This also 
                indicates that the monument was built to mark the city’s foundation as well. As per the historian Historian Mohammed Safiullah, Charminar was built as an 
                epicenter of Hyderabad.
                The construction began in<small>1589</small>and was completed in two years with a<small>cost of Rs. 9 lakhs,</small>which was<small>around 2 lakhs huns/gold coins</small>in 
                those times. It is said to weigh around 14000 tonnes with a minimum of 30 feet deep foundation.
